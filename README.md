## About

Leidos Rollvan has been made for you to comfortably explore and browse the best local food trucks in your area.
It provides a platform to smaller, independent business owners to advertise their businesses and reach a wider user base in a highly competitive space dominated by large chain businesses. 

This android application allows users to explore nearby food trucks on a simple Map based UI and discover great, cost-effective deals being offered by local businesses in real-time.

With a free registered account, users can gain access to a subscription feature to their favourite food trucks to stay updated with changes and never miss any ongoing offers. A registered account also helps users add their most frequented food trucks to a favourites list so they can be accessed at any time. However, this app is completely usable without registering an account with us. 

Business owners have to register for a business account to advertise their businesses to users. They can create and customise their business profile to attract more clients and be informative about their available food menus. Businesses have the ability to create and notify all subscribed clients about their ongoing offers at the touch of a button. Business locations are very easily changeable to allow mobile food trucks to keep their locations updated regularly. 

This application was originally created by:
- Anirbit Ghosh
- Alex Chak
- Kieran Sharp
- Ben Johnston
- German Cherstvov
It was released under the GNU GPLv3.

#### Known Bugs in current release

Limitations and bugs identified in the current version of the app:
- Map fails to load on startup. Requires refreshing the map page several times to render all map data. On some devices rapidly refreshing the map page twice will load the map immediately and continue working as expected. The cause of this bug was not identified and solved as it could not be recreated on the development environment's Android emulator. It is only a bug experienced when using this feature on a real mobile device with the latest Android version.
